# Locawork
## Find a nearest possible work or help and meet up!
Locawork has found a similarity with an ants and human.
ants are purposeful for their small and logical movement.
Because of this very tiny ants has build up many terribly huge nests.
A nest like this big is for human like a 8th world wonder,
but for ant it is every-day normal to see such a huge nests.
They are very organized and Locawork tries to be the same to bring
people together for solving issues that others need ASAP.

Main goal of an app:
This application finds the nearest help needers
around your desired radius.
Also it helps to confirm when the helper reached to help and also
when the help is in progress or finished. Right now these last two stages are
still in a development.

Regulations:
Regulations of government for the price per help are still in development phase.
